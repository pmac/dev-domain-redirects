# pmac.io redirector

A redirector service for various domains to point to my primary one. They are .dev domains so https is required
and the redirects that my registrar will do are http only ðŸ˜ž 

Hosted on my [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=d069f8df6df96b5407f86bbc2dde1424435ba75c) and deployed using [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/).
