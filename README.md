# thepy.dev and thedjango.dev Redirector

A redirector service for my python-related .dev domains to point to other URLs. They are .dev domains so https is required.

Hosted on my [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=d069f8df6df96b5407f86bbc2dde1424435ba75c) and deployed using [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/).

Would you like your own subdomain redirector? Just submit a PR to this repo with an update
to the [cnames.toml](cnames.toml) file and I will merge and deploy it if it's reasonable.
